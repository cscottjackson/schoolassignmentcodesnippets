# schoolassignmentcodesnippets
A collection of files from my time at Austin Peay State University working towards my B.S. Computer Information Systems, Systems Development, 
minor Information Security and Assurance.

Many of my projects from school have been lost due to a hard drive failure.

<b><i>Many of the items in this repo are incomplete</i></b>, first drafts, or completed pieces of a working program.

Customer.cpp contains the functions that allow the user to view the menu options, create new customers in the database,
change or delete existing customers, and display all current customers in the database created in Database.cpp/Database.h.

Database.h contains the neccessary member functions, mutators, accessors for private member variables. Default Constructors and destructors
included.

Customer.h contains the Customer class with functions to create and manipulate existing customer objects.

Database.cpp contains the neccessary functions to open and close a database object, fetch, update, and sort database records.

As stated above these are just a few files of many that were lost, which I am trying to recover to upload to this repo.
Reminder these files are not finished and a collection of things I had saved to a flashdrive for a short period of time during school.
